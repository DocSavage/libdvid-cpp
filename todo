X-make dvid server and check for existence (info?)

X-make dvid node and check for existence
X-create coords, channels, and size utilities
X-make DVIDVoxels generic type (initialization from string) -- just use c_str casted to template -- prevent 2D start, convert all 2D slices to 3D (2D x 1)

X-implement get/put interface (especially with JSON)
X-deal with binary data object since it is really a string -- just create string from char *? -- what about unnecessary copying -- figure this stuff out
X-create buildem setup (create libdvid.cmake, make new boost cmake -- check for duplicate?, make netlib cmake, copy binaries, make sure includes copy, make simple cmake for simple app)

??s:

-includes are not being moved to the correct directory (do I have to specify the headers explicitly?)
-must include boost libs and other libs explicitly (might need to support find package?)




-make an example taking dvid server, uuid, and option
-integration tests?; extensive debug
-documentation
